# Pipe Master 2000

Pipe Master currently only adds a single item, the Pipe Goggles.
They allow the wearer (just hold it in your hand) to see various plumbing through the walls.

Which pipes are visible can be configured by right-clicking the tool.

This is a Work-In-Progress mod at a rather early state.
